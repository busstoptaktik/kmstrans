    <h1>Python Console</h1>
    <p>The python console lets you inerface with the python bindings for
      TrLib allowing you to automatise trivial tasks by simple python
      scripts.<br>
      You can extend the functionality by placing plugins (as usual
      python packages, see
      http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html ) in a folder
      named:<br>
      ~/.trui/plugins&nbsp; <br>
      On windows, the users home directory ~ is typically: C:\Documents
      and Settings\&lt;my_user_name&gt;<br>
      <br>
      At the moment only "scripting" plugins usable from the python
      console are supported. However, the grand plan is to implement a
      more general plugin structure where it is possible to extend the
      user interface by adding extra tabs. <br>
