    <h1>GDAL <br>
    </h1>
    <p><b>KMSTrans2&nbsp;</b> depends on <a href="http://gdal.org">GDAL/OGR</a>
      for transformation of data sources in the batch tab as well as for
      displaying a coast line in the map window. Currently only the OGR
      part of GDAL is used to transform vector data. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Windows only:<br>
    </h2>
    <p>A prepackaged version of <b>KMSTrans2</b> with prebuilt
      binaries&nbsp; will come also with a (minimal) GDAL installation,
      which the binaries are linked against (gdalxxx.dll located in the
      <b>bin</b> subfolder, where xxx is a version number e.g.
      gdal110.dll) </p>
    <p>If you have a compatible gdal installation (currently
      gdal110.dll)&nbsp; on your computer, possibly with more drivers
      enabled, you can override the default GDAL installation simply by
      deleting or renaming <b>gdalxxx.dll</b>&nbsp; in the <b>bin</b>
      sub folder. You may also want to delete or rename the <b>gdal-data

      </b>sub folder - if this folder is present KMSTrans2 will set the
      GDAL_DATA environment variable to point to there. </p>
    <p>Advanced users are encouraged to install a full gdal version,
      available e.g. from <a href="http://gisinternals.com/sdk/">here</a>,
      in order to enable all OGR drivers (like WFS, Postgis and
      Spatialite).<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Building binaries yourself:<br>
    </h2>
    <p>If you build the binaries yourself with the included build script
      - <font face="Courier New">build.py </font>- it is up to you to
      choose an appropriate GDAL installation/version to link against.<br>
