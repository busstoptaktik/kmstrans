    <h1>GDAL <br>
    </h1>
    <p><b>KMSTrans2&nbsp;</b> depends on <a href="http://gdal.org">GDAL/OGR</a>
      for transformation of data sources in the batch tab as well as for
      displaying a coast line in the map window. Currently only the OGR
      part of GDAL is used to transform vector data. <br>
      For all operating systems, except Windows, KMSTrans2 will use a
      'system install' of GDAL, i.e. the GDAL libraries and dependencies
      must be installed in locations pointed to by relevant environment
      variables.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Windows only:<br>
    </h2>
    <p>A prepackaged version of <b>KMSTrans2</b> with prebuilt
      binaries&nbsp; will come also with a (minimal) GDAL installation,
      which the binaries are linked against (currently gdal110.dll)<b>.
      </b>The directory layout of the default GDAL installation is
      (relative to the root directory of KMSTrans2):<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>gdal -&gt; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        bin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        (subfolder containing gdal binaries, e.g. gdalxxx.dll and other
        dependencies)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gdal-data&nbsp; (subfolder
        containing gdal data files)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        plugins&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (subfolder containing
        optional gdal plugins)<br>
      </b></p>
    <p><b>There are several ways of customizing the used gdal
        installation:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify the included <b>gdal</b> folder - applies if you have
        KMSTrans2 installed locally (on your own hard drive):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Put your own version of gdalxxx.dll (currently
          gdal111.dll) and libraries which gdal depends on in the <b>bin

          </b>subfolder.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Place optional plugins in the <b>plugins</b>
          subfolder.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;If needed modify also the data files in the <b>gdal-data</b>
          subfolder.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>The GDAL installation can also be customized from the
      'GDAL settings' dialog, which is opened from the 'Settings' menu:<br>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a compatible GDAL installation on your system
        select 'Use system gdal'. This requires that you have set the
        PATH and relevant GDAL environment variables properly on your
        system.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>Or:<br>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the 'Use customized gdal' radio button and select proper
        folders in the text fields below. The GDAL Bin folder should
        contain the gdalxxx.dll and other binary dependencies.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Changes to the GDAL setup requires a restart to take effect.<br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    Advanced users are encouraged to install a full gdal version,
    available e.g. from <a href="http://gisinternals.com/sdk/">here</a>,
    in order to enable all OGR drivers (like WFS, Postgis and
    Spatialite).<br>
    <h2>Building binaries yourself:<br>
    </h2>
    <p>If you build the binaries yourself with the included build script
      - <font face="Courier New">build.py </font>- it is up to you to
      choose an appropriate GDAL installation/version to link against.<br>
