    <h1>GDAL <br>
    </h1>
    <p><b>KMSTrans2 / trui</b> depends on <a href="http://gdal.org">GDAL/OGR</a>
      for transformation of data sources in the batch tab as well as for
      displaying a coast line in the map window. Currently only the OGR
      part of GDAL is used to transform vector data. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Windows only:<br>
    </h2>
    <p>A prepackaged version of <b>KMSTrans2</b> with prebuilt binaries
      will come also with a (minimal) GDAL installation, which the
      binaries are linked against.<br>
      Relative to the root directory&nbsp; (where the Trui.py or
      KMSTrans2.exe file is located) the structure of this installations
      is:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>gdal/bin - a folder containing shared libraries (.dll), e.g.
        gdalxx.dll and various additional libraries that this dll is
        linked against.</li>
      <li>gdal/plugins - a folder containing optional plugins for GDAL
        (might be empty or non existing, depending on the distribution).
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>gdal/gdal-data - a folder contaning data files needed by
        various GDAL drivers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can override the GDAL installation by simply dropping in
      another compatible GDAL installation with a similar directory
      structure.<br>
      &nbsp;If you already have a compatible GDAL installation on your
      computer which is included in your PATH environment variable, you
      can simply delete the gdal folder in the root directory, or run<b>
      </b>the program<b> </b>from the command line with a <b>-my_gdal
      </b>option.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Building binaries yourself:<br>
    </h2>
    <p>If you build the binaries yourself with the included build script
      - <font face="Courier New">build.py </font>- it is up to you to
      choose an appropriate GDAL installation/version to link against.<br>
      <br>
