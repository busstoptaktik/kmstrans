    <h1>Bessel Helmert Tab<br>
    </h1>
    The Bessel-Helmert formulas are used to calculate distances and
    directions on the ellipsoid. <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Geodesics and Azimuths</h2>
    Ellipsoidal geometry is used. In this geometry "straight lines" are
    the geodetic lines/geodesics, i.e. the shortest line from one point
    to another on the ellipsoid. Thus, 'angle' refers to angles between
    crossing geodesics and 'direction' to the directions of geodesics
    (see below).<br>
    From each point (except the north pole) on the ellipsoid the
    geodesic to the north pole is used as reference for other geodesics
    passing through that point: The direction of a geodesic in a point
    is called an <b>azimuth</b> and is measured as the angle between
    the reference direction (towards north) and the geodesic. <br>
    <br>
    When two points (Stn1 and Stn2) on the ellipsoid are connected by a
    geodesic, the azimuths of the geodesic connecting the points are
    called the "Forward" and the "Backward" azimuth respectively. The
    forward azimuth is measured in Stn1 as the azimuth towards Stn2. The
    backward azimuth is the azimuth of the geodesic towards Stn1.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Modes</h2>
    For a setup of two points connected by a geodesic, you can use this
    widget to calculate unknown elements from given (elements).<br>
    The dialogue has two modes, each corresponding to the calculation
    type:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Based on coordinates to two points, calculate the ellipsoidal
        distance between the points and the forward and backward
        azimuths.</li>
      <li>From distance and direction (forward azimuth) from one
        coordinated point, calculate the coordinates of the other point.
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Radio buttons in the lower left corner are used to toggle the mode
    selection.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Coordinate systems</h2>
    In both modes, you have to select the input system which the
    coordinates of the two stations refer to - ellipsoid parameters are
    taken from this system. The geometric calculations (distance and
    azimuth) will be performed on the corresponding ellipsoid. <br>
    It is also possible to define a custom ellipsoid by specifying major
    axis and flattening. The coordinate system will always be geographic
    in this case.<br>
