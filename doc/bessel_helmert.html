    <h1>Bessel Helmert Tab</h1>
    In the Bessel-Helmert Tab you can calculate distances and directions
    on the ellipsoid. <br>
    <h2>Geodesics and Azimuths</h2>
    Ellipsoidal geometry is used. In this geometry "straight lines" are
    the geodetic lines/geodesics, i.e. the shortest line from one point
    to another on the ellipsoid. Thus, 'angle' refers to angles between
    crossing geodesics and 'direction' to the directions of geodesics
    (see below).<br>
    <br>
    From each point&nbsp; on the ellipsoid (except the north pole), the
    geodesic to the north pole is used as reference for other geodesics
    passing through that point: The direction of a geodesic in a point
    is called an azimuth and is measured as the angle between the
    reference direction (towards north) and the geodesic. <br>
    <br>
    When two points (Stn1 and Stn2) on the ellipsoid are connected by a
    geodesic, the azimuths of the geodesic connecting the points are
    called the "Forward" and the "Backward" azimuth respectively. The
    forward azimuth is measured in Stn1 as the azimuth towards Stn2. The
    backward azimuth is the azimuth of the geodesic from Stn 2 towards
    Stn1.<br>
    Calculation Mode<br>
    For a setup of two points connected by a geodesic, you can use this
    widget to calculate unknown elements from given elements.<br>
    The Bessel Helmert calculation has two modes, each corresponding to
    the calculation type:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Based on coordinates for two points, calculate the ellipsoidal
        distance (the length of the geodesic) between the points and
        calculate the forward and backward azimuths.</li>
      <li>From distance and forward azimuth from one coordinated point,
        calculate the coordinates of the other point. <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Buttons in the lower left corner are used to toggle the mode
    selection.<br>
    <h2>Coordinate systems</h2>
    In both modes, you must select the input system for the coordinates
    of the two stations - ellipsoid parameters are taken from this
    system. The geometric calculations (distance and azimuth) will be
    performed on the corresponding ellipsoid. <br>
    It is also possible to define a custom ellipsoid by specifying
    semi-major axis and inverse flattening. The coordinate system will
    always be geographic in this case.<br>
