# KMSTRANS2 #
KMSTrans2 is a graphical user interface for (KMS)trlib.

Have a look at the wiki-pages for more information.

Version 2.2 has been released! Available from the downloads tab.

**This version is declared FINAL and will receive no updates**

The trlib functionality is currently being reimplemented through
extensions to the (much more widespread) PROJ.4 library
(https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/).

Once this process has been completed, the KMSTrans 2 functionality
will be directly available through the huge number of geospatial programs
using PROJ.4, hence largely eliminating the need for KMSTrans 2.
